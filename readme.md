## Final assessment Requirements: 
### Requirements 
Final Assignment Part 1 - 20%
Due Date: Sunday, December 7th @ 23:59
Submission: Moodle ‘Week 11 Assignment’
You are required to download and render JSON data via an API endpoint or endpoints. The API endpoint(s) should not be one we have used before and must be approved by myself in advance. When displaying the JSON data, you should dynamically create and style elements to render the data. You cannot use sample code from the Internet.
You are expected to render the endpoint data by dynamically creating and styling elements on the page. You are not required to render all JSON properties, but should include on a Word document
(i) A sample of the JSON data (e.g. one object) (ii) the data points you will be using and why and (iii) a rough diagram (e.g. pen and paper screenshot) of how the data will be displayed. Finally (iv) a link to your public GitHub repo should be provided
This is due on Monday December 2nd on Moodle (23:59) ‘Sample Data’ Link on Moodle. Failure to upload will result in a deduction of 15% from your overall mark. Your endpoint(s) MUST be approved by me before you upload this document.
A distinction level award will require the following:
· The ability to render JSON from more than one endpoint
· The use of more than one API
· Elegant design when rendering the endpoint data
· The ability to render data based on two or more user-selected criteria or the ability to search
· The ability to render complex JSON objects (objects within objects, arrays etc.)
· The use of appropriate async code which is modular
· Code clearly documented
· Two or more async functions
· The use of GitHub (commits with appropriate messaging)
Note: the lab classes on the week of December 2nd will be used to allow you to work on your assignment, get feedback etc. If you don’t attend the lab class, you will be docked 20% from your overall mark.
Deadlines:
Friday, November the 29th 17:00– Endpoint(s) approved by me. Submit before then ideally, as your endpoint(s) may be declined if someone else is using it or it is too rudimentary.
Monday, December 2nd @ 23:59: Sample data uploaded as described above
Sunday, December 8th @ 23:59: Submission of work to Moodle. This will consist of a 2 – 3 minute video of you demonstrating your code working and a ZIP file of all your code. JavaScript libraries or frameworks are not allowed. You must also upload your JavaScript code to Turnitin
Where necessary, I will have a Q&A with students. Assignment Extension Request form Assignment Extension Procedure
